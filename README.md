# Trifle

Trifle is a platform designed to facilitate anonymous problem-sharing and project generation. Users can anonymously post problems they face in their daily lives, and an AI-powered system generates project ideas for users. These ideas can span various domains including software, hardware, finance, etc. Users can then develop these project ideas, post them on the platform, and earn rewards. Both problem posters and project developers maintain digital anonymity throughout the process.
